## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔐 **ML-Based Cybersecurity (NSF REU)**
Trained ML models on 1M+ samples for IoT threat detection (99% accuracy), and developed a real-time RAG-based LLM mitigation agent (~94–98% similarity). [Project Details Coming Soon]

### 🧠 **Dementia Care Alert System (Princeton Hackathon)**
Built a full-stack web app with DeepFace to recognize familiar faces in real time (~97% accuracy, <1s latency), with integrated safe-zone tracking for caregiver alerts. [🔗 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/lakshita1212/HackPrinceton)

### 📈 **Insurance Premium Prediction**
Developed a Random Forest regression model on 2M insurance records with custom preprocessing; achieved ~1.15 RMSE on Kaggle. [🔗 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Abhisri436/Insurance_Premium_Prediction)

### 📊 **Chart Interpretability Research**
Analyzed 200+ scientific charts to study how visual and textual elements impact interpretability; built models to uncover patterns in multimodal chart design. [🔗 NiiV Lab](http://niiv.njitvis.com)
